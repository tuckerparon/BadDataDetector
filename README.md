# Bad Data Detector 🕵🏻‍♂️

## What? 💻
The file detects bad data from a large collection of messy training data. The training data is for a chatbot called Jarvis run through Slack via the Slack API. The data files contain a category (the output) and various phrases (the input). The code was written with the help of project teammate (in team MOUNTAINTIGER for STAT 287) Katey Forsyth, a UVM graduate student. The repository includes the python file including the bad data detecor as well as a data folder including the 70 datafiles.

## Why? 🤔
This was a 'challenge assignment' within the final project of my STAT 287 (Data Science I) course at the University of Vermont. Of this course involving 40 students (mostly graduates) with groups of 3 to 4 students, this detector earned second place in terms of performance.
